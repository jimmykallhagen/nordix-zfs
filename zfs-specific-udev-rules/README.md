# **60-ioschedulers.rules** - _ZFS the smart file system_

Normally, it is the kernel that is responsible for ensuring that file systems 
and storage are handled correctly in a system. This is different when it comes 
to ZFS. You can think of it as having two systems in your system — ZFS takes 
over control of file system and storage, while the kernel steps aside.

Therefore, we need to make sure that ZFS is allowed to handle these things itself.

**Technological explanation:**
ZFS has its own I/O scheduler that understands the pool topology (mirrors, 
stripes, special vdevs). The kernel's scheduler doesn't know about this and 
can make suboptimal decisions. Setting `none` lets ZFS handle all scheduling.

```
### HDD
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]*", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", \
    ATTR{queue/scheduler}="none"

### SSD
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]*|mmcblk[0-9]*", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="0", \
    ATTR{queue/scheduler}="none"

### NVMe SSD
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="nvme[0-9]*", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="0", \
    ATTR{queue/scheduler}="none"
